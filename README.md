# Mexican-American Restaurant Order System

## Overview

This project is a restaurant order system built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to choose from a menu of food items, select extras for their meal, and calculate the total cost. The order summary is then saved to a text file.

## Features

- **Food Menu**: Includes Tacos, Burritos, Enchiladas, Burgers, Pizza, and Ice Cream.
- **Extras**: Each item has extra options such as guacamole, sour cream, mushrooms, and more.
- **Order Calculation**: The system calculates the total price based on the selected food and extras.
- **Order Summary**: Displays the total price and a detailed order summary.
- **Text File Output**: The order is saved to a text file for record-keeping.
- **Interactive GUI**: The system uses Tkinter to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. **Install Python**:
- If Python is not already installed, download and install it from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Tkinter**:
- Tkinter is required for the GUI. Install it using pip if it's not already installed:

4. **Run the Program**:
- After installing Python and Tkinter, navigate to the project folder and run the program:


## How It Works

1. The user enters their name.
2. The user selects a food item from the menu.
3. The user chooses any extra options available for the selected item.
4. The system calculates the total cost and displays a summary.
5. The order details are saved in a text file (`restaurant_order.txt`).

## Limitations

- Only a limited set of food items and extras are available.
- The program does not handle any input errors beyond basic validation (e.g., empty name or missing orders).

## Future Improvements

- Add more food items and extras.
- Implement additional error handling for more robust user input.
- Enhance the user interface with more advanced Tkinter features.
- Support for multiple orders at once or order history.
